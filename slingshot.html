		<h1>Object Falling Simulation</h1>
	</div>
	<p1>This simulation will cover the outside forces that are taking place when an object is dropped. Before starting the simulation, I suggest that you take a look over the information I have provided on how gravity works, the affect of wind on dropping objects and how objects are able to bounce. </p1>

	<h2>How gravity works</h2>
	<p2>Gravity is very important as it keeps everything on Earth. Without gravity, everything would float off into space. The more mass an object has, the more gravity. Gravity also gets weaker with distance. So, the closer objects are to each other, the stronger their gravitational pull is. Everyone's gravity is attracted to the Earth as it is the largest object in our vicinity. The acceleration of gravity on Earth is 9.8m/s². It differs for other planets due to their weight and place in the solar system. Some bodies in space such as the moon with an acceleration of 1.62 m/s² allows us to still be pulled towards it but with less of a strength so we can jump higher and fall slower due to the slower acceleration.

	<h2>Affect of wind on an object</h2>
	<p2>As wind is just air in motion, it creates momentum. This momentum is what causes an object to change direction when wind hits it. The momentum is being transfered into the object causing it to move with the wind. Once again, the more mass an object has, the less it will be affected by the wind. This is why plastic bags are seen floating around in the wind while a heavier object such as a car remains unaffected. This may change depending on how strong the wind is as storms tend to have heavier winds making heavier objects move. </p2>

	<h2>How objects bounce</h3>
	<p3>Bouncing is a matter of energy storage and recovery. When two objects collide the both store energy. When they rebound, they release a portion of that stored energy propelling the original moving object into the air. Bouncing is a perfect example of Newton's 3rd law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When two objects collide, there is the equal action of storing energy then the opposite reaction of rebounding off each other. More ductile objects such as rubber are able to absorb a lot of energy even when changing its shape and release the majority of that. This is why objects that bounce higher are made out of rubber e.g handballs and basketballs. Mass is also very important as the less mass an object has, the higher it bounces due to the less energy being required to accelerate the bounce.</p3>
